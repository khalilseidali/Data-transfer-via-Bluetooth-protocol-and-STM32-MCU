# Data-transfer-via-Bluetooth-protocol-and-STM32-MCU
In this project, we intend to send some information about Room temperature that is sensed By LM35.
These Data's will transfer with Bluetooth communication protocol. 
(HC-05 module as Transmitter and mobile Bluetooth port as receiver). 
In this project, ADC unit of microcontroller STM32f103c8xx is used to receive analog data. 
In cube IDE, the relevant processes and calculations will performed and Finally, the information is transmitted to the HC-05 module via UART connection. 
descriptions of the code is Written in the comments  in Cube IDE.
Also, pin connections and pinouts is explained by a picture in the RAR file.
